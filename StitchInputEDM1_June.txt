OpenBeamJune.tif #Name of the open beam including file type (eg. tif)
# The following information is degree information to inform the algorithm
0.0 #degree that the image stack starts with (often 0.0)
78.0 #degree that the code should use for mutual information
1.0 #increment between images in the stack
360 #number of total images in the stack (usually 360.0 for the tomography stacks)
0.103 #effective pixel width (mm/pixel) used to verify stitching size
38.1 #size in mm of the actual object (measured/estimated)
no #answer to if mutual information on either side is blocked by the beam
N/A #answer to which side is blocked left, right, top, bottom, both, N/A (for none)
